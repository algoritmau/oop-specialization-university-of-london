# Object-oriented Programming Specialisation

This file contains my notes on the University of London's [Object-oriented Programming Specialisation](https://) program.

## Specialisation description

There are several programming paradigms in computer science. One of the most
important, especially when creating large software projects, is object-oriented
programming, or OOP. OOP allows the integration of data and processes on that data
into discrete software modules. Learning about OOP will allow you to develop more
modularised, more complex software designs. It will also let you understand better how
many existing software libraries and systems have been designed.

There are also several programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, Java and
so on. Many languages support OOP. In this specialisation we have chosen the C++
language as our object-oriented language. C++ is a popular language which enables
the development of a range of software, from low level operating system components
through to high performance graphical programs. With C++, you can build any program
you want and it will run fast!

This specialisation consists of five courses aiming to help you to become confident
working in the object-oriented paradigm in the C++ language. During the five courses,
you will work with the instructor on a single project: a crypto-currency exchange
platform. Whilst building the project, you will learn about a range of programming
techniques from basic control flow and input/output through to file parsing, object-
oriented techniques and user interaction in the console.

## Specialisation learning outcomes

Upon successful completion of this Specialisation, you will be able to:
1. Understand and explain the key principles of object-oriented programming
2. Choose appropriate basic data types to represent different data
3. Write classes with data and functions that model discrete elements of programs
4. Describe the components of an integrated development environment (IDE) and
  use an IDE to write, build and run programs in the C++ language
5. Use control flow, classes and input/output to construct interactive programs and
  algorithms of moderate complexity

## Course 1 - This course

In this first course, you will get started with C++ by writing, building,
and running your first program. You will then learn about text input/output,
if statements and loops by building an interactive menu system
for the crypto-currency exchange platform.

### Key concepts

- C++ edit, compile and run cycle
- Text I/O
- Functions

### Learning outcomes

- Write, compile and run a C++ program that prints messages to the console
- Use the standard library to do text I/O in the console
- Use a while loop to repeatedly receive and respond to user input
- Write and call simple functions

## Course 2

Using classes and variables to model data: the `OrderBookEntry` class, part 1

### Key concepts

- Basic data types: numbers and string
- Classes and data
- Classes and functions

### Learning outcomes

- Select appropriate data types to represent a dataset in a C++ program
- Describe how a class can be used to combine multiple pieces of data into one unit
- Write a class with functions

## Course 3

File I/O, exception handling and algorithms: the `CSVReader` class, part 1

### Key concepts

- Translating pseudocode to C++
- Exception handling
- File I/O

### Learning outcomes

- Convert pseudocode algorithms involving iteration, logic and string processing into
working C++ code
- Use exception handling to gracefully recover when processing unreliable data
- Read text data from a file using the `getline` function

## Course 4

Writing and testing an algorithm: taking orders and the order matching engine, part 1

### Key concepts

- Iterating over vectors
- Exception handling

### Learning outcomes

- Write functions that calculate basic statistics by iterating over vectors of objects
- Use test data to evaluate the correctness of an algorithm
- Use exception handling to write robust user input processing code

## Course 5

Object interactions: the `wallet` class

### Key concepts

- Object interactions
- Modelling real world items with classes
- Static and non-static functions

### Learning outcomes

- Use object interactions to achieve complex functionality through a simple command sequence
- Explain how to model a familiar real-world entity as a class with data and functions
- Decide when it is appropriate to use static or non-static functions
